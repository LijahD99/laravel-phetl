# Phetl Architecture Documentation

*A comprehensive guide to understanding the Phetl ETL package architecture*

## 📁 **Documentation Structure**

This folder contains detailed architectural documentation to help you understand and continue development of the Phetl ETL package.

### **Core Documents**

1. **[System Overview](01-system-overview.md)** - High-level architecture and design philosophy
2. **[Design Patterns](02-design-patterns.md)** - Detailed analysis of patterns used throughout the system
3. **[Component Architecture](03-component-architecture.md)** - Deep dive into major components and their relationships
4. **[Class Hierarchies](04-class-hierarchies.md)** - Detailed class structure and inheritance patterns
5. **[Data Flow](05-data-flow.md)** - How data moves through the ETL pipeline
6. **[Extension Points](06-extension-points.md)** - How to extend and customize the system
7. **[Performance Considerations](07-performance-considerations.md)** - Architecture decisions for performance and scalability

### **Quick Navigation**

- **Getting Back Into the Codebase**: Start with [System Overview](01-system-overview.md)
- **Understanding Design Decisions**: Read [Design Patterns](02-design-patterns.md)
- **Component Relationships**: See [Component Architecture](03-component-architecture.md)
- **Class Structure**: Review [Class Hierarchies](04-class-hierarchies.md)
- **Data Processing**: Understand [Data Flow](05-data-flow.md)
- **Customization**: Learn about [Extension Points](06-extension-points.md)
- **Performance**: Study [Performance Considerations](07-performance-considerations.md)

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This documentation serves to:

1. **Reorient** you with the codebase architecture after time away
2. **Explain** the reasoning behind key design decisions
3. **Document** the intended patterns and practices
4. **Guide** future development and extensions
5. **Preserve** architectural knowledge and intent

## 🚀 **Recommended Reading Order**

For **returning to the project after a break**:
1. System Overview → Design Patterns → Component Architecture

For **understanding specific components**:
1. Class Hierarchies → Data Flow → Extension Points

For **performance optimization work**:
1. Data Flow → Performance Considerations → Component Architecture

## 📝 **Maintenance**

Keep these documents updated as the architecture evolves:
- Update class diagrams when adding new classes
- Document new design patterns as they're introduced
- Revise performance considerations based on benchmarks
- Add new extension points as they're created
